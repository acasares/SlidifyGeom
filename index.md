## The original problem and the actual data:##

*** =right

**Given AX, BX and CX, is the 4th distance DX determined?**  

- Answer: Yes, with Pythagoras'  help.    

For instance:    
Let BX = 9, CX = 7, AX = 3    

$DX = \sqrt{{BX}^2+{CX}^2-{AX}^2}$

```r
  DX <- sqrt(BX^2+CX^2-AX^2)
  cat(sprintf('DX = %3.1f',DX))
```

```
## DX = 11.0
```

## The general question: extreme values of the areas    

*** =left

### For a given set of distances: 

The point X moves only along a circle with   r=AX and center   A.

When X moves, the rectangle adjusts its dimensions to keep the distances.

**To see it and examine the  problem's behaviour, the application allows you:**    
- To choose the three data distances in a select box.
- And vary the polar angle $BAX = \alpha$, that sets the position of point X, through a slider control.
- The figures react to these changes. You can see how the area keeps changing.

**Between what limits?**

### Empirical procedure:

- Areas computed in each point of an uniform sample. 

- The extreme areas may be easily computed from it. 

- The figure shows the answers for a set of 901 distances

- The minimum value of the area is at polar angle BAX = 0 degrees.

## Analytical - Numerical Procedure

**Finding the analytical function and its derivative is hard to do.**

- In accordance to Calculus, at the extremes of a function its derivative is zero.

- We'll look for angles making the derivative null, without using the cumbersome function. 

- Through numerical derivatives, shown in blue, that exhibit good linear pattern.

- Thus, a linear model (*magenta*) fits them with high R-squared, crossing the X axis at almost the same point.

- Answers are practically identical, and close to empirical ones.
